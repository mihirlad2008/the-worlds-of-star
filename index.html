      1. What is a galaxy? What are the various components of
      a galaxy ?
      2. What are the different types of stars ?
       The following figure shows different stages in the
      lifecycle of stars after their birth from a nebula.
      Discuss these in the class.
      20.1 Lifecycle of stars
      Our solar system is a tiny part of a galaxy called the Milky Way, which is
      many, many times larger than the solar system. There are lakhs of stars in the
      Milky Way, some of them being many times bigger than our Sun. Some of them
      have their own planetary systems. Stars in the Milky Way show a great diversity
      in colour, brightness, as well as size. Some stars, which appear to be close to one
      another making a particular figure are together known as a constellation. We shall
      learn more about constellations in this chapter. But, before that, let us learn a few
      basic concepts related to sky watching.
      Nebula
      Ordinary star
      Massive star
      Red giant star
      Red super giant star
      Planetary nebula
      White dwarf
      Neutron Star
      Supernova Black Hole
      We have already learnt about galaxies and stars as well as the solar system and
      its different components. Stars are born out of nebulae. Nebulae are clouds made up
      mainly of hydrogen gas and dust particles. The particles in these clouds are attracted
      towards one another due to the force of gravity. As a result, the cloud contracts and
      becomes dense and spherical in shape. At the same time, the pressure of the gas at the
      core of the cloud increases causing the temperature to rise tremendously and energy
      generation processes start there. Such a spherical cloud of hydrogen is called a ‘star’.
      Later, processes such as contraction, expansion, rise in temperature, etc. bring about
      changes in the nature of the star. These changes occur over a very long period of time
      and constitute the lifecycle of stars. The different forms of the stars at various stages
      during this lifecycle are identified as different types of stars.

      sky watching
      Stand still in an open space and look into the distance. What
do you notice about the ground and the sky? Now, still looking
into the distance, turn around yourself and observe the ground
and the sky as you do so.
Far away, the sky seems to be touching
the ground. The line at which they meet is
called the horizon. While turning around
oneself, the horizon will be seen to form a
circle and on looking up, the sky will appear
to be a sphere based on this circle. The stars
and planets moving in the sky appear to be
moving on this sphere. This virtual sphere
is called the celestial sphere. The circular
horizon divides this sphere into two halves.
1. Zenith : While standing on the ground,
the point on the celestial sphere exactly
above our head is called the zenith.
2. Nadir : While standing on the ground,
the point on the celestial sphere exactly
below our feet is called the nadir.
3. Celestial poles : If we extend the axis of
rotation of the earth in the north and south
directions it will penetrate the celestial
sphere at points called the celestial North
Pole and the celestial South Pole, respectively.
4. Meridian : In astronomy, the great circle
which passes through both the celestial poles
and the observer’s zenith and nadir is called
a meridian.
5. Celestial equator : If we uniformly
expand earth’s equator in all directions
indefinitely, it will penetrate the celestial
sphere along a circle. This circle is known
as the celestial equator. It is in the same
plane as the earth’s equator.
6. Ecliptic : The earth moves around the
sun, but, seen from the earth, the sun
appears to move along a circle on the
celestial sphere. This circle describing the
apparent motion of the sun around the earth
is called the ecliptic.
Sky and space
Sky : Standing in an open space,
if we look at the sky on a
cloudless night, we see numerous
stars against a dark background.
The portion of earth’s atmosphere
and the portion beyond that which
can be seen in the form of a roof
by our eyes while standing on the
earth is called the sky.
Space : The continuous, empty
space between the spheres (planets,
stars, etc.) in the sky is called
space. It may contain gas and
dust particles. Numerous star
clusters have formed in space.
The sun, the moon and the stars are
seen to rise in the east and set in the west
because the earth rotates from the west to
the east. If we observe carefully, we will
also notice that stars rise and set 4 minutes
earlier every day. That is, if a star rises
at 8 pm tonight, it will rise at 7:56 pm
tomorrow. Against the background of stars,
the sun and the moon appear to move
from the west to the east, the sun moving
through one degree every day and the
moon through 12 to 13 degrees. This
happens due to the motion of the earth
around the sun and that of the soon around
the earth. 
A group of stars occupying a small portion
of the celestial sphere is called a constellation.
Some of these stars appear to form certain figures
of animals, humans or objects. These figures
have been named after certain events or beliefs
of the times when the constellations were
identified. In this way, western observers have
divided the celestial sphere into 88 constellations.
Similarly, ancient western astronomers put
forward the idea of 12 zodiac signs, whereas
Indian astronomers suggested the 27 nakshatras.
Zodiac sign : The ecliptic has been imagined to
be divided into 12 equal parts. Thus each part
subtends 30 degrees at the centre of the celestial
sphere. Each of these parts is called a raashi or
zodiac sign. They are named Aries, Taurus,
Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio,
Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces.
Nakshatra : The moon completes one revolution
around the earth in approximately 27.3 days. The
portion traversed by the moon in one day is called
a nakshatra. So if we divide 360 degrees into 27
equal parts, each part is about 13 degrees and 20
minutes. A nakshatra is known from the brightest
star that it contains. This brightest star is called
the yogatara. Which nakshatra we can see during
a sky watch depends upon the position of the
earth along its orbit.
1. The place for sky watching should
be away from the city and, as far
as possible, it should be a new
moon night.
2. Binoculars or telescopes should
be used for sky watching.
3. Identifying the Pole Star in the
north makes the sky watch easier.
Hence, the Pole Star should be
used as a reference point for sky
watch.
4. As the stars in the west set early,
sky watching should begin with
stars in the west.
5. As in geographical maps, the east
and west are shown to the right
and left respectively in a sky map.
6. On a sky map, the north and south
are towards the bottom and top of
the map respectively. This is
because the sky map is to be held
overhead. Hold the sky map in
such way that the direction we
face is at the bottom side.
Using a Marathi calendar,
collect information about the 27
nakshatras and divide them into the
following three categories:
Monsoon nakshatras
Winter nakshatras
Summer nakshatras
One zodiac sign = ….. nakshatras.
Getting to know some constellations
1. During summer nights one can see a particular
arrangement of seven stars. We call them Saptarshi.
In the month of February, this constellation rises
around 8 pm in the north-east. It is on the meridian
in the month of April and in the month of October, it
sets around 8 pm. As the name suggests, Saptarshi is
a group of seven bright stars. It is in the shape of a
quadrangle with a tail made up of three stars. It thus
resembles a kite and can be easily recognized. If we
extend one side of the quadrangle, it reaches the Pole
Star or Polaris as shown in figure 20.3. Different
countries have different names for this constellation.
In English it is called the Great Bear.
2. The constellations of Saptarshi and Sharmishtha
or Cassiopeia are useful in locating the Pole Star.
Sharmishtha is made up of five bright stars which are
distributed along the figure of the letter M. The
perpendicular bisector of the line joining the third and
fourth stars in Sharmishta goes towards the Pole Star.
(See figure.) The Pole Star has Saptarshi on one side
and Sharmishtha on the other. As Sharmishtha sets,
Saptarshi rises. Thus, we can always use either one
or the other as a reference point on any given night.
3. Mrug nakshatra or Orion has very bright stars.
On winter nights, they can be easily identified. It has
seven - eight stars of which four are at the corners of
a quadrangle. The line passing through the three
middle stars of the constellation, when extended, meets
a very bright star. This is Vyadh or Sirius. During
the month of December, Mruga nakshatra rises at 8
pm on the eastern horizon. It is on the meridian during
February and in June, it sets around 8 pm.
4. Vrushchik or Scorpio is a constellation with 10
to 12 stars. Jyeshtha or Antares is the brightest among
them. This constellation is below the equator, in the
sky of the southern hemisphere. In the third week of
April, it can be seen in the eastern sky a few hours
after sunset.

With the help of your friends, draw a big circle on the
ground as shown in figure 20.4. Ask twelve of your friends to
stand at equal distances along the circle, each holding a placard
with the name of one zodiac sign in proper order.
In this figure, when
the girl looks at the flower
pot, in addition to the
flower pot, she also sees
the trees in the
background.
The observer looking at the sun sees not only the sun but also a constellation
behind the sun. The constellation cannot be seen in bright sunlight, but it is indeed
present behind the sun. As the earth changes its position, a different constellation
or zodiac sign or raashi appears behind the sun. This is what we express when we
say that the sun enters a particular zodiac sign or raashi. For example, on Makar
Sankranti we say that the sun enters Makar raashi (Capricorn zodiac sign).
When the earth is at A, for an observer on the earth, the sun appears to be
in the Scorpio zodiac sign. When the earth moves from A to B, the observer will
say that the sun has entered Libra. In reality, the sun does not move, but we
perceive it as moving due to the motion of the earth around it. This motion of the
sun is called its apparent motion and its path is called the apparent path. The
rising of the sun in the east and its setting in the west is also an apparent motion.
You might have heard some elders saying that a particular nakshatra is in the rising
and now prevails. It means that, at that time, if you look at the sun from the earth,
that particular nakshatra is behind the sun and gives you an idea about the position
of the earth revolving around the sun.
Make one friend stand as the sun at the centre of the circle. Now, move along
a smaller circle around the sun, as if you are the earth, facing the sun all the time.
What do you notice as you move along this circular orbit ? Ask your friends to
take turns to do the same. Discuss what everybody sees.
